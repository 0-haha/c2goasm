# c2goasm: C to Go Assembly 

## Introduction

This is a tool to convert assembly as generated by a C/C++ compiler into Golang assembly. It is meant to be used in combination with [asm2plan9s](https://github.com/minio/asm2plan9s) in order to automatically generate pure Go wrappers for C/C++ code (that may for instance take advantage of compiler intrinsics).



Mode of operation:
```
$ c2goasm /path/to/c-project/build/SimdAvx2Detection.cpp.s SimdAvx2Detection_amd64.s
$ asm2plan9s SimdAvx2Detection_amd64.s
```

Optionally you can nicely format the code using [asmfmt](https://github.com/klauspost/asmfmt):
```
$ asmfmt SimdAvx2Detection_amd64.s
```

This project has been developed as part of developing a Go wrapper around [Simd](https://github.com/ermig1979/Simd). However it should also work with other project and libraries.

## Invocation

```
$ c2goasm /path/to/c-project/build/SomeGreatCode.cpp.s SomeGreatCode_amd64.s
```

## Example

Here is a simple example.

C code
```
```

C assembly
```
```

Go assembly
```
```

Go code
```
```

## Internals

- Map function arguments from Golang calling convention into C calling convention
- Setup an (aligned) stack for the C code
- Get constants from Go assembly table to handle `rip`-based loads (PIC = position independent code) 

Caveats
- Arguments need to be 64-bit size (either a value or a pointer) 
- No `call` statements (i.e. inline your C code)

## Generate assembly from C/C++

See list of assembly targets
```
$ make help | grep "\.s"
```

See actual command
```
$ make -n  SimdAvx2BgraToGray.s
```

Additional arguments to aid in assembly generation

## Tested compilers
